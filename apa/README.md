**Arbitrary-precision arithmetic.**

*This is project is a work-in-progress experiment.*


## Motivation

The motivation behind this library is to have arbitrary-precision integers,
that can be assigned to a `const` for smaller values. The intent is to create
a standalone library that can also be included in the [jca] library.
